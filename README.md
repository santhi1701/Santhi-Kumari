## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a passionate AI & Data Science student with strong interest in full-stack development and machine learning. I specialize in building **real-time web apps** using Python, Django, and JavaScript — with experience in intelligent resume analyzers, quiz platforms, and elegant frontend websites.

🔍 I enjoy blending frontend design with backend intelligence, and I'm always learning new technologies to grow as a developer.
